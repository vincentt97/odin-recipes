        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A very easy recipe for garlic bread that is made with roasted garlic, butter and Parmesan cheese.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 heads garlic</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 (1 pound) loaf Italian bread</li>
            <li>Â½ cup butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley (Optional)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Slice the tops off of garlic heads so the tip of each clove is exposed. Place garlic on a baking sheet and drizzle with olive oil. Bake until garlic is soft, about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Set the oven to broil. Slice the loaf of bread in half horizontally, and place cut-side up on a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Squeeze the cloves of garlic from their skins into a medium bowl. Stir in the butter, parsley, and Parmesan cheese until well blended. Spread onto the cut sides of the bread.</li>
            <li>Broil bread until toasted, about 5 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
